# Message_Crush

Created this interactive webpage featuring a playful question "You like me?" with two response buttons. Clicking "Yes" changes the text to a friendly acknowledgment and switches the displayed GIF to a cheerful cat image. Hovering over "No" causes the button to evade the cursor, moving to random positions on the screen. Used tutorial from tiktok page: Codesphere.
