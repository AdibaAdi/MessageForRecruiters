# Message_Recruiters

Created this interactive webpage trying to convince recruiters to hire me for internships "Can I please get the internship?" with two response buttons. Clicking "Yes" changes the text to a friendly acknowledgment and switches the displayed GIF to a cheerful cat image. Hovering over "No" causes the button to evade the cursor, moving to random positions on the screen. Used tutorial from tiktok page: Codesphere. 

Language used: HTML5, CSS and JS.
